This repository contains a chat application built using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. The application allows users to create or join chat rooms and engage in real-time conversations.

## Features

- User authentication with Google using Firebase authentication.
- Create or join chat rooms by entering a unique room name.
- Real-time messaging within chat rooms.
- Sign out option for logging out of the application.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Firebase: A mobile and web application development platform.
  - Firebase Authentication: For user authentication.
  - Firebase Realtime Database: For storing and synchronizing chat room data.

## Prerequisites

To run this application locally or deploy it to a hosting platform, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
- npm: Node package manager.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get started with the chat application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure Firebase:

   - Create a new project on the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com).
   - Enable Google authentication in the Authentication section.
   - Create a new Realtime Database in the Database section.
   - Set the database rules to allow read and write access:

     ```json

       "rules": {
         ".read": true,
         ".write": true
       }
     }
     ```

   - Copy the Firebase configuration object by clicking on "Project settings" and then "Add app" under "Your apps".
   - Replace the Firebase configuration in the `src/firebase.js` file with your own configuration.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open the application in your web browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
